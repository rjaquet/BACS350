# Code

All of the coding tasks are built around the list of work that needs to be done.

In agile software development this is often call the Product Backlog when it refers
to the total work that is pending.

The Scrum practice calls for fix amount of items to be pulled off the Product Backlog
and implemented for the next Sprint Cycle.

Each Sprint proceeds to completion as developers focus exclusively on completing the 
Sprint Cycle.   This requires that all requirements, design, code, test, deployment,
and documentation are completed for each feature that is chosen for the Sprint.

I believe that Scrum produces strong results but that it is also possible to achieve
these results with less rigor and ceremony.  It is the principles of Scrum rather
than the practices that give the benefit.

My approach to the coding phase is simply to have a To Do List that is the plan
for what must be done next.  

Activities must be balanced between different mindsets for the remaining work

* Test
* Fix
* Extend
* Improve

The [Shrinking World Software Planner](ToDo)
encapsulates these ideas into a very simple plan.  This plan is updated
continuously as work is done.  Reality is contantly changing so the plan must
be updated frequently as new information is discovered.


All work must be reviewed weekly with the boss and the client.  This is a form of the
Sprint Planning Meeting.   A demo is given for the finished results and
the [Accomplishments](Done) are reviewed with the client.  New work is then
added to the [Plan](ToDo) for the next week of work.

This weekly review is essential for the health of the project and managing
expectation.   It is an opportunity to discuss risk and potential threats to 
the project.  Doing this practice for just a few weeks converts a relationship
of low trust into high trust.   Clients will give much more automnomy to 
developers once they know precisely what they are doing.
